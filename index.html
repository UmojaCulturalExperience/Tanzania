Volunteering abroad in orphanages and with vulnerable children can be an eye-opening experience. It offers you the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of those who need it most and to gain a deeper understanding of the world.<br><br>

By volunteering, you can provide emotional support, educational assistance, and basic needs such as food and shelter to children who have lost their parents or are living on the streets. You can also learn about the culture and society of the Tanzanian people, which can help broaden your perspective on life.<br><br>

Imagine if you were a child with no home to sleep in, and perhaps no family to protect you. It would be difficult to obtain your daily necessities without guidance, and even more difficult to access education or simply enjoy being young.<br><br>

Many children around the world run away from home, are abandoned, orphaned, or live in desolate areas. Some have special needs or disabilities without access to rehabilitation. Some just need someone to play with and give them love and care. As an international volunteer, you have the opportunity to extend love and support to them through this program.<br><br>

Providing Educational Support: Teaching basic English and reading books<br>

Offering Emotional Support: Spending time with the children, playing games, doing art, and listening to their stories<br>

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for our planet and our future. While government policies and corporate action are crucial in addressing this global challenge, individual efforts also play a significant role.<br><br>
Our modern world is now experiencing a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, mostly caused by a build-up of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gases. Rising sea levels, extreme weather, loss of natural habitats, and loss of human lives are just a few consequences.<br><br>
Climate change volunteering is an intervention effort, providing people from all walks of life with an opportunity to make a positive impact. Whether it is helping with reforestation projects, raising awareness about climate change in a community, or supporting research and innovation, every small step counts.<br><br>
UCE offers a special placement for volunteers who have shown interest in environmental conservation programs and are passionate about Environmental Sustainability and Global Climate Action.<br><br>
During your volunteering period in Tanzania, you will learn about the local climate, weather patterns, environmental issues that affect the area, and natural disasters. During these sessions, you will learn about Government Sustainability efforts to reduce emissions, protect natural resources, and promote renewable energy. You will also learn about political and economic factors, understanding how politics and economics impact climate change, including any environmental policies or initiatives in the area.<br><br>

VOLUNTEERING ACTIVITIES:<br><br>

Planting trees<br>

Participate in clean-up campaigns in the local community<br>

Maintaining/improving water catchment areas<br>

Educating the community about climate change by leading workshops and giving presentations<br>
